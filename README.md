Kreuzberg is a polyglot document intelligence framework built around a high-performance Rust core. It helps developers extract text, structure, metadata, and embeddings from 56+ document formats at native speed, without requiring GPUs.

Kreuzberg is and will remain MIT-licensed and open-source. We're currently building a hosted cloud service around it to make document processing reliable, scalable, and easy to integrate into modern pipelines.

## What is Kreuzberg

### 1. Kreuzberg (Open Source, MIT Licensed)

A high-performance, extensible document intelligence engine.
